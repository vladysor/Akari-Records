* New cards with 5min → 15min steps
* Failed cards with 10min → 1hour steps
* After 5 failed reviews card is suspended

### Note Type
My favourite Anki Note Type for Japanese is [jp-mining-note](https://github.com/arbyste/jp-mining-note). You can find installation gudie [here](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/setup/#installing-jp-mining-note). After that you can read through [Reference](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/ui/) to understand card structure and Note Type features.

!!! example
    You can download [my sample card](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpV1fMM3mi5A1MsDRPjv_sGjAWMqP-bF/view?usp=sharing) to see how I usually use this template. The only thing I changed is the field order to make card creation a bit easier.

One of my favourite things about this note is that you can hover over kanji and see in which your other card this kanji was used. Very helpful to make connections between cards and increase retantion rate.

!!! warning
    Card will create a warning if you have multiple cards for the same word. I personally ignore them and don't mind having multiple cards in multiple contexts for complicated words.
